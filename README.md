# MadLibs
A quick and simple window that shows the outputted display of your MadLib.

## Description

Madlibs is a simple way to get a story from everyday words through user inputs. The user picks a story, and by following the prompts on the terminal, you end up with a creative (and sometimes wacky) story.

## Code

Madlibs uses Tkinter to create and display a window to the user. The user is then able to select a story of their choosing, and prompts will be given through the terminal. With the use of the terminal and Tkinter, Madlibs is able to generate a brand new and original story using the users inputs as a way to provide a custom and unique experience. 

_{Madlibs currently uses the terminal as a way to obtain user input, and will soon allow user input through the Tkinter window.}_ 

### Demonstration

Here are two screenshots of how Madlibs works!
